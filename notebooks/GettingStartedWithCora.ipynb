    "--\n",
    "\n",
    " **Awali** is written in C++ and is organised into three layers: the *static*, the *dynamic*, and the *interface* layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the platform is the **static level**, which provides the data structures and a library of algorithms. The *type* of a weighted automaton -- called the *context* -- is determined by the type of weights and the type of labels. Every algorithm is implemented via template functions working on template classes, and is compiled for the type of automata that are used. Efficiency is partly based upon this generic programming which is anyway essential when dealing with weighted automata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dynamic level** allows both the call of functions of the static level and genuine C++ programming with the use of a kind of *universal* type of automata. This type is an abstraction of template (static) types of automata; it gives access to a complete template-free API for weighted automata. \n",
    "A remarkable feature of the dynamic level is the *on-request compilation* of modules (data structures and algorithms) from the static level. Even written at the dynamic level, programs are compiled and not interpreted at execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **interface level** offers for the time being two kinds of access to the lower layers: a *command-line interface*, called **Cora**, which allows the call to most of the algorithms of the static level, and a Python interface to both the dynamic and the static levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to begin with Awali platform is probably to play with the command-line module Cora and this is what is described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is at hand ? \n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "After Awali installation, the command **cora help** gives an overview of the usage of Cora and, as important, the way to list all available commands, examples, and documentation."
